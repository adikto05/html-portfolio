<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Aydan. I'm a computer engineering student at METU/TAU.
   I like to watch movies and read books.</p>

<p>I'm also working on my back-end development skills.
   Although I'm new to this branch, it's going really well by far.</p>

<p>I'm a really dedicated student with high grades, 
  but my achievements in university are not my only achievements.</p>
